    "description": "Last September, I visited Sri Lanka, also known as the Pearl of the Indian Ocean. My main goal was to practice wildlife photography, so I booked visits to 5 national parks hoping to capture images of Indian Leopards. Although I only managed to capture one for a brief 5-minute period on my first safari, and almost gave up after a bumpy 6-hour safari ride.\n\nI was overwhelmed by the beauty of this country and surprised that I was inspired to capture many other aspects of Sri Lanka, including gorgeous landscapes, coconut tree farms, golden beaches, beautiful waves, tea plantations, misty mountains, mighty elephants, and various other wildlife.\n\nThe warm welcome and hospitality of the people of Sri Lanka, as well as the cleanliness of the roads, made this trip especially memorable. I was very satisfied with the combination of landscape and wildlife photography during this trip.\n\nSpecial Thanks @ishara_s_ekanayaka and Shanta for their great help. \n\n\n#djiair3 #dronevideo #landscapevideo #oceanwaves #srilankatravel #nikonvideography #nikonz6iii #nikonlens #naturelover #wildlifephotography",
