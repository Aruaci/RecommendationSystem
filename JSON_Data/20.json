Despite it being one of my favourite soundtracks of all time, I thought to myself that I wasn't skilled enough as a composer to tackle even one piece from it. I'm no John Powell, but I knew that all of you were eager for me to do it. \n\nSo began, a two-month musical journey of composing non-stop until 5 AM in the early morning. This experience has opened up a lot of new ideas for me in regards to orchestration. I normally stayed away from listening to masterpieces like John Powell's score because of the anxiety that it brings to me echoes, thoughts that I will probably never achieve a sound close to it...\n\nBUT, by allowing myself to immerse in the works of the greats, made me realize the little details you won't really hear on first listen. It was surreal, it was like using a microscope to discover a whole completely different environment that brings life to the world. I then knew I can only improve if I surround myself with works from every spectrum.\n\nAs I went on, the ideas began coming in and the piece became more ambitious. It was a challenge to find a way of making my work unique from the plethora of fantastic covers done by other talented composers. So I thought to myself of using a balance of different unique aspects. \n\nAside from larger instrumentation, additional counter melodies, and structural differences, I also opted to use unconventional instruments for a few pieces in the medley, Not just to make it unique, but as a message (and middle finger) to backwards-thinking purists, believing that an orchestra should not contain unconventional instruments like synths or rock guitars.\n\nI'm not against a purist orchestra, but I am against the \"enforcement\" of a purist orchestra, and to those who support said enforcement of traditional norms, You're boring, and the song in this medley, \"Sticks & Stones\" is specifically composed for you üòèüî•\n\nI had the honour of working with an old friend, Haley Collins, or as most of you may know her as @its_draconix. She has been amazing with helping me out with previous compositions, now she has collaborated with a specific song in the medley by providing some truly fantastic vocals! Fun fact: She was originally the set vocalist for my Dragonhearted orchestration before TimCvo!üëÄ\n\nI also had the honour of having @nugisdrawing on board to work with some unconventional instruments as well! üëÄ\n\nAfter 2 months of hard work, the finished piece is what you're about to hear now. I've learned that sometimes in life, you have to tackle that one thing you're trying to avoid, because surrounding yourself with works that are unfamiliar gives you the best opportunity to learn. \n\nSo did I deliver?
