    "description": "Today I am sharing my delicious linguine with shrimp and arugula recipe. My garden has started to bloom and I have a lot of arugula already. It is my favorite time of year to be able to pick fresh produce from my garden and cook delicious recipes in my kitchen, just several feet away. The peppery taste of arugula pairs well with the linguine and shrimp in this recipe. I hope you enjoy!\n\nWritten Recipe: http://orsararecipes.net/linguine-with-shrimp-and-arugula\n\nSupport my cooking videos on Patreon: https://www.patreon.com/orsararecipes\n\n~MERCH~\n2021 recipe calendar: https://www.createphotocalendars.com/Store/Pasquale+Sciarappa+2021+Recipe+Calendar-9581391158\nMy t-shirts: https://teespring.com/stores/orsararecipes\nMy aprons: https://www.cafepress.com/orsararecipes/12456823\n\n~Social Networks~\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/OrsaraRecipes\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/OrsaraRecipes\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/orsararecipes\n\n~My PO Box info~\nPO BOX 4129 \nLong Branch NJ station B 07740",
